## List of Tasks

Run a workflow
on any GitHub event
Kick off workflows with GitHub events like push, issue creation, or a new release. Combine and configure actions for the services you use, built and maintained by the community.

Whether you want to build a container, deploy a web service, or automate welcoming new users to your open source projectsâ€”there's an action for that. Pair GitHub Packages with Actions to simplify package management, including version updates, fast distribution with our global CDN, and dependency resolution, using your existing GITHUB_TOKEN.
